This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates the use of transfer learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform image classification. The project leverages pre-trained models to transfer knowledge and improve classification performance on a new dataset.

## Overview

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for a particular task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. This project utilizes pre-trained models such as MobileNet to extract features from images and fine-tunes the model to classify new image categories.

## Features

Utilises pre-trained CNN models for feature extraction.
Fine-tunes the model to adapt to a new dataset.
Implements techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and model evaluation.
Provides a step-by-step guide to applying transfer learning for image classification.
